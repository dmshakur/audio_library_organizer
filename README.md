
## Audio Library Organizer

I made this little program entirely on my phone. It is an MVP, minimum viable product. It works just fine with mp3 files, I would like to add more later on. I've tested it out on 1 album, and it worked perfectly fine, definitely not the first time though. I would like to test it out on my entire music library, but I only have a few GB left on my phone and a 50+ GB library. I'll test it when I get a new laptop as my last one was stolen.

I would like to go through this app in the future, make it more professional and include testing and a more robust interface, maybe even a gui. But as of right now, other projects are in a greater demand of my attention.
